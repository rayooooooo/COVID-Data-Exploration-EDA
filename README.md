# COVID‑Data‑Exploration‑EDA

## Project Overview
This SQL‑based data analysis project explores global COVID‑19 trends using two primary datasets: **CovidDeaths** and **CovidVaccinations**. It demonstrates insights into infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze total COVID cases and deaths by location and continent  
- Compute death‑percentage and infection percentage relative to population  
- Compare continental and global death patterns  
- Track vaccination progress as rolling sums and percentage of population vaccinated  
- Showcase SQL techniques including aggregations, window functions, CTEs, temp tables, and view creation

## Technical Approaches
- Organized and commented T‑SQL queries to improve readability and logic flow  
- Usage of advanced SQL features: **CTEs**, **window functions (OVER … PARTITION BY)**, **Views**, and **temporary tables**  
- Clean ordering and filtering for easy interpretation and reproducibility
